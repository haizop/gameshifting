# BoardStateing

This app is a Rails + React implementation of Gameshifting, an interactive tool and group meeting process, developed by Emerging Leader Labs and Agile Learning Centers.

# What is Gameshifting?

Gameshifting is a tool that allows a community to better facilitate meetings. Part of its purpose is to make the implicit social rules explicit, and thus give permission to change them. It can help the group alter its dynamic so it can function more efficiently to accomplish different sorts of tasks. The fancy word for this is “polymorphism”: taking many forms.

Groups often get stuck in singular patterns: the teacher is in charge, the boss must be pleased, tip toe around the executive secretary, some people talk and others listen. When groups get stuck in those patterns, creativity and the ability to adapt are impaired. While a singular existing pattern might be usable for one type of outcome, it limits the group to that one kind of outcome. Being able to intentionally change the patterns helps groups engage polymorphically: they can take many forms, and achieve many kinds of outcomes.

The Gameshifting process takes the individual cycle of intention, creation, reflection, and applies it to group dynamics.
